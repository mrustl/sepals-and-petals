Welcome to Sepals and Petals! This package's apps are built with [appifyr](github.com/retowyss/appifyr). 

```{r}
library(appifyr)

# Create inputs as dropdown
dd <- inp_dropdown(names(iris)[1:4], width = 6)

# "sepals_and_petals" is a function in this package
appify(f = "sepals_and_petals", inps = list(x = dd, y = dd))

```
